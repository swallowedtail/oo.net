							 <h2>Identification please!</h2>
							 <p>Hi all,<br>
							 <br>
							 Can you help with identifying these people?</p>
							 <p>These are the bridesmaids in the wedding photo: I think the one on the right is Vera Baines isn't it? (is that how you spell it?). Could the one on the left be Mum's friend Gert, who later took to calling herself Trudie? The young bridesmaid in the front looks very familiar to me. Do you recognise her?
					</p>
							<p>Paul said the tall thin man on the right is Ronnie, but I don't think it is. I can't see Iris anywhere, she'd be there wouldn't she? Could it be uncle Frank? This is 1946, which would make Dad 28yo, Mum 26 and Ronnie about 21 or 22. I think this man looks older than that, don't you? While I think of it, wasn't there a bit of a tiff between Mum and Iris because Mum was originally sweet on Jack? Or something like that...</p>
							<p>Have I got the names mixed up? Was it Vera Baines and Bill Baines, and there was Hazel Wally (is she the bridesmaid, not Vera?). Then there was auntie Edna - what was her surname - was her husband named Ted? Then there was Gert and ??? I keep thinking Gert and Daisy, but I might have got that from a radio show or something! The only other of Mum's friends I remember are auntie Merrier (Maria) (oh, my poor-a back-a) and a woman name Maisie that Mum knew from the rag trade I think. I probably made that up.</p>
							<p>The two boys in these photos are Terence and Andrew I think. Andrew was Hazel's son - was Terence also Hazel's?</p>
							<p>And who the devil is the man standing next to Nan-nan - Do you think that might be Fa? Or could it be uncle Peter's dad? Did Mum used to have this photo? The more I look at it the more I keep getting deja vu, especially about that man in the raincoat.</p>
							<p>Looking forward to your contributions folks, then I'll send the photo to everyone and put it online with the names of everyone.</p>
							<p>June, do you think uncle Sid might have come down for the wedding? - the woman behind Mum looks a bit like I remember auntie Joyce.</p>
