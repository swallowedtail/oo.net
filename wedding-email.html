<h2>Identification please!</h2>
							 <p>Hi all,<br>
							 <br>
							 This wonderful pic of Mum and Dad's wedding (follow link at bottom) was sent to us by cousin Lesley in Oz. Can you identify anyone?</p>
							 <p><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;" src="images/wedding/bridesmaid1.png" width="100" alt="" /><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="images/wedding/bridesmaid2.png" width="100" alt="Hazel?" />These are the bridesmaids in the wedding photo: I think the bridesmaid on the right is Hazel Whalley isn't it?  Could the one on the left be Mum's friend Gert, who later took to calling herself Trudie? The young girl in the front looks very familiar to me. Do you recognise her?</p>
							<p><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="images/wedding/thinman.png" width="100" alt="" />Paul thinks the tall thin man on the right is Ronnie, but I'm not so sure. Ronnie would only have been almost 17. This is November 2 1946, which would make Dad 28 years old and Mum 26. I think this man looks older than that, don't you? Mum's brother Frank would have been 23 - perhaps it's him.</p>
							<p><img src="images/wedding/raincoat.png" alt="" width="217" height="138" style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;" />Who is the man in the raincoat standing next to Nan-nan - do you think that might be Fa? I think uncle Peter would know. Could it be uncle Peter's dad? Frances, did Mum used to have this photo? The more I look at it the more I keep getting d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, especially about that man in the raincoat.<br /></p>
                     <p>Have I got the names mixed up? Was it Vera Baines and Bill Baines, and Barry Baines their son?  Hazel Whalley, who had sons Andrew and Terence was Mum's friend who used to visit. Then there was auntie Edna - what was her surname - was her husband named Ted? Then there was Gert and ??? I keep thinking Gert and Daisy, but I might have got that from a radio show or something! The only other of Mum's friends I remember are Italian auntie Merrier (Maria) (oh, my poor-a back-a) and a woman called Maisie that Mum knew from the rag trade I think. I probably made that up.</p>


							<p>Looking forward to your contributions folks; I hope you can straighten out my memory - please reply to <a href="mailto:romit3@sky.com?subject=Wedding Photo comments" target="_blank">romit3@sky.com</a></p>
